About Marta:
 
Marta is a MOM of two, certified Kundalini Yoga teacher, social worker and co-vlogger at FitForTwoTV - a resource dedicated to health where youll find delicious plant-based recipes, wellness tips, and motivational home workouts. She advocates a balanced approach to wellbeing that includes nurturing the body, mind and spirit for optimal living.
 
Martas life wasnt always balanced and happy. In 2005, a health crisis set Marta on the path of natural healing. She began to make first-time life changes by committing herself to healthy eating and regular fitness. In 2011, a spiritual crisis set Marta on the path for deeper answerslater that year she was invited to attend a local Kundalini Yoga class. It wasnt until she stepped on the yoga mat that she truly found her SELF. Ever felt like nothing was missing? She was hooked. She devoted herself to a daily practice of Kundalini Yoga. It blossomed from a hobby to a way of life that has transformed and elevated her emotionally, physically, spiritually and energetically.
 
In 2013, Marta completed Level 1 Kundalini Yoga Teacher Training with Sat Dharam Kaur in Toronto, Ontario. This is where she experienced yet another surprising and heartfelt calling: to guide others in their journey of happiness, healing, self-discovery and transformation through this sacred practice.
 
She continues to deepen her commitment to yoga through personal practice and wide ranging workshops/trainings. Her long-term goal is to complete the 500-hour training through the Kundalini Research Institute. She has additional certifications in Vitality and Stress, and Yin Yoga.
 
She remains deeply grateful to all teachers and students alike who continue to inspire her journey.
 
Marta lives in Ontario, Canada with her husband, Brock, two homebirth babes, and two puggles.

Asana is one of the eight limbs of classical Yoga and states that poses should be steady and comfortable, firm yet relaxed. The yoga asanas gently encourage us to become more aware of our body, mind, and environment.
The 12 basic poses or asanas are much more than just stretching. They open the energy channels, chakras and psychic centers of the body while increasing flexibility of the spine, strengthening bones and stimulating the circulatory and immune systems. Along with proper breathing or pranayama, asanas also calm the mind and reduce stress. With regular practice one can increase overall physical and mental health and the aid in the prevention of diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and arthritis. In time, the poses consciously becomes a mental exercise in concentration and meditation.

Most practitioners, of Yoga Nidra, find with regular practice relief from physical and mental stress,  tension in the body, and report feeling more balanced,  less fight or flight mode of the nervous system, leading to profound calming of the mind. 
Yoga Nidra should be practiced in a comfortable position--using supports if needed, around and under the joints. Tthe body should be kept warm so, wear thick socks add a warm blanket, turn the lights off, and use an eye pillow to help settle the mind and body more easily into stillness.
Remember, It doesnt matter if you fall asleep during the practice, or you forget the instructions, your body and subconscious will still reap the benefits and rewards. When you notice you are drifting off just come back to the voice...
On a practical level, nidras can be practiced at any time of day but dont practice whilst driving or operating dangerous machinery or equipment. Make sure you have plenty of time to come out of the deep hypnagogic, Nidra state. Fully awaken all the senses of the body before moving on with the rest of your day.

 182: Yin Yoga vs Restorative Yoga with Nyk Danu

  

 Description:

 Slower styles of yoga such as Yin Yoga and Restorative Yoga are becoming more popular as people are seeking balance in their hectic, fast-paced and stressful lives. However, while Yin and Restorative yoga are often used interchangeably, and may even seem similar externally, there are many differences between the two. Yin Yoga expert (and a member of The Connected Yoga Teacher Team) Nyk Danu shares more about these two types of yoga.

  

 Nyk Danu has been teaching yoga for 15 years, and is a Yin Yoga expert and teacher trainer. She is also a Yoga Therapist who helps people with back pain, particularly those she describes as yoga misfits - people who dont feel at home in mainstream Yoga circles. As a teacher trainer, Nyk also offers Yin Yoga modules as a complement to existing teacher training programs and 1:1 Yin Yoga apprenticeships for teachers. She is also currently in the planning stages of an online Yin Yoga Teacher training.

  

 Despite appearing similar, these two practices differ greatly. Nyk shares more about the origins of each of these styles of yoga and the intention behind them, as well as some of the key differences in the length of poses, counter poses, and use of props. Nyk also has some great insights about the internal perspective - physiologically, emotionally, and how each type of yoga impacts the nervous system.

  

 If you are considering taking specialized training on Yin Yoga or Restorative Yoga, or are wondering who each type of yoga is suitable for, or just want to deepen your understanding about these two practices, this episode is perfect for you.

  

 Key Takeaways:

 [4:16] Shannon introduces her guest for this episode - Nyk Danu

 [6:19] What does Nyk do and who does she do it for?

 [7:34] Nyk shares where her definitions and frameworks for Yin Yoga and Restorative Yoga come from.

 [9:26] Nyk explains how yin-yang theory ties into Yin Yoga.

 [11:32] What is Yin Yoga? What is Restorative Yoga? What is the difference between them?

 [16:48] Nyk gives an example of how a post could be done in Yin vs Restorative yoga.

 [19:22] What are the intentions of each type of yoga practice?

 [21:25] Nyk explains more about the resonance or echo of a pose in your body, which is unique to Yin, and about the meditative elements of Yin Yoga.

 [24:39] Who would Nyk recommend Yin Yoga to?

 [29:48] Different teachers have different approaches to Yin Yoga.

 [32:19] What are the differences in the emotional landscape between Yin vs Restorative Yoga?

 [34:15] How long are poses held in Yin Yoga and Restorative Yoga?

 [35:31] What is the usual duration of classes for these practices of yoga?

 [38:34] How long are Nyk's Yin Yoga classes?

 [39:46] Nyk explains how she guides students through her Yin Yoga classes.

 [41:17] Which practice has more talking through each pose?

 [44:04] Does Nyk use music in her Yin classes?

2065,FXWIDbl0U2I,50 Minute Morning Yoga Based On Vinyasa Flow For Beginner | Yograja,"This style of yoga links movement with the breath, creating flowing postures that smoothly transition from one to the next. In Sanskrit, the word vinyasa means connection. Each movement connects with either an inhale or an exhale. You can expect to move through a few sun salutations, warrior poses, balancing poses, back bends, and seated stretches. Each class ends in savasana, which is the final relaxation pose.
There is no strict format or sequence of poses in a vinyasa class, allowing for more creativity on the part of the teacher. Some classes are more spiritual, incorporating breath work, chanting and meditation, while others are more athletically-oriented. It depends on the instructor, so if one class doesnt suit you, try a different instructor.
Depending on the level, Vinyasa yoga can be gentle or rigorous. If youre a beginner, look for a gentle flow or a level 1 class. Learn the basics before moving on to more advanced classes (level 2 or higher).
Commonly called ""Vinyasa flow"" or just ""flow"", you'll definitely be moving, flowing from one pose to the next. Other than starting with a sun salutation, no two classes will be alike.
